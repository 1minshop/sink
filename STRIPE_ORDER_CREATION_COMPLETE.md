# Order Creation After Stripe Checkout - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Order Creation Function (`lib/db/order-actions.ts`)

- Added `status` parameter to `CreateOrderData` interface
- Supported status values: "pending", "paid", "completed", "cancelled"
- Updated `createOrder` function to use provided status or default to "pending"

### 2. Updated Stripe Webhook Handler (`app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`)

- Enhanced `checkout.session.completed` event handling
- Added logic to check Stripe payment status and set order status accordingly:
  - If `payment_status === "paid"` → Order status = "paid"
  - Otherwise → Order status = "pending"
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Added handling for `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded` event
- Improved error handling and debugging output

### 3. Added Testing Scripts

- `scripts/test-order-creation.js` - Test order creation functionality
- `scripts/check-orders.js` - Query recent orders and their status
- `scripts/test-webhook.js` - Guide for webhook testing

## ✅ How It Works

1. **Customer completes Stripe checkout**
2. **Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` webhook**
3. **Webhook handler processes the event:**
   - Extracts order data from session metadata
   - Checks payment status (`session.payment_status`)
   - Sets order status to "paid" if payment is successful
   - Creates order record in database
4. **Order appears in dashboard with correct status**

## ✅ Database Schema

Orders are created in the `public.orders` table with:

- `status`: "paid" for successful Stripe payments, "pending" for QR code payments
- `payment_method`: "stripe" for Stripe payments
- `stripe_session_id`: Stripe checkout session ID
- `stripe_payment_intent_id`: Stripe payment intent ID

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Order Creation

```bash
cd /Users/douglasswm/1min/saas-starter
node scripts/test-order-creation.js
```

### Check Recent Orders

```bash
node scripts/check-orders.js
```

### Test Complete Checkout Flow

1. Go to a shop subdomain (e.g., `http://shop1.localhost:3000/shop`)
2. Add items to cart
3. Complete Stripe checkout
4. Check logs for webhook processing messages
5. Verify order appears in dashboard with "paid" status

### Test Webhook Locally (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI if not already installed
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login to Stripe
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local development
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook

# In another terminal, trigger a test event
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

## 🔍 Debugging

Check the console logs for these messages:

- `"Received Stripe webhook event: checkout.session.completed"`
- `"Processing checkout.session.completed webhook for session: [session_id]"`
- `"Payment status: paid Order status: paid"`
- `"Order created successfully: ID: [order_id] Session: [session_id] Status: paid"`

## ✅ Status Mapping

| Stripe Payment Status | Order Status |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| `paid`                | `paid`       |
| `unpaid`              | `pending`    |
| `no_payment_required` | `paid`       |
| Other values          | `pending`    |

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

- **Successful Stripe payments** → Order status: "paid"
- **QR code payments** → Order status: "pending" (default)
- **Failed/cancelled payments** → No order created
- **Webhook failures** → Logged errors, no order created

The implementation ensures that orders are properly created with the correct status reflecting the actual payment state from Stripe.
