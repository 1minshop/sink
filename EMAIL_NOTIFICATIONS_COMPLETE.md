# Email Notifications System - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ Overview

The email notifications system automatically sends order confirmation emails to customers and notification emails to store owners when orders are marked as paid. This works for both Stripe payments and QR code payments.

## üîß Components Implemented

### 1. Email Service (`lib/email/service.ts`)

- `sendOrderConfirmationEmail()` - Sends confirmation to customers
- `sendOrderNotificationToStore()` - Sends notifications to store owners
- Uses Resend API for email delivery
- Supports both USD and INR currencies
- Includes error handling and logging

### 2. Email Template (`lib/email/templates/order-confirmation.tsx`)

- React-based responsive email template
- Professional design with 1 Minute Shop branding
- Itemized order details with pricing
- Payment method-specific messaging
- Clean typography and layout

### 3. Integration Points

- **Stripe Webhook** (`app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`) - Sends emails when Stripe orders are paid
- **QR Code Payments** (`lib/db/order-actions.ts`) - Sends emails when QR code orders are confirmed
- **Store Owner Email Retrieval** - Gets owner email from team members table

## üõ† Environment Setup

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=orders@yourdomain.com
```

### Getting Resend API Key

1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Go to API Keys section
3. Create a new API key
4. Add it to your `.env` file

### Setting From Email

- Use a domain you own (e.g., `orders@yourdomain.com`)
- Or use Resend's onboarding domain for testing

## üîÑ How It Works

### Stripe Payments

1. Customer completes Stripe checkout
2. Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` webhook
3. Order is created with "paid" status
4. Email notifications are sent automatically

### QR Code Payments

1. Customer uploads proof of payment
2. `updateOrderWithProofOfPayment()` is called
3. Order status is updated to "paid"
4. Email notifications are sent automatically

## üìß Email Types

### Customer Confirmation Email

- **To:** Customer email from order
- **Subject:** `Order Confirmation #12345 - Store Name`
- **Content:** Order details, items, payment method, total amount

### Store Owner Notification Email

- **To:** Store owner email (team member with "owner" role)
- **Subject:** `New Order #12345 - Store Name`
- **Content:** Customer details, order summary, total amount

## üß™ Testing

### Test Email System

```bash
node scripts/test-email-notifications.js
```

### Test Complete Flow

1. **Stripe Payment Test:**

   - Go to shop subdomain
   - Add items to cart
   - Complete Stripe checkout
   - Check emails for confirmation and notification

2. **QR Code Payment Test:**
   - Go to shop subdomain
   - Add items to cart
   - Select QR code payment
   - Upload proof of payment
   - Check emails for confirmation and notification

## üîç Debugging

### Check Logs

- Stripe webhook logs in terminal
- Email sending logs with success/error messages
- Store owner email retrieval logs

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Environment Variables:**

   - Check RESEND_API_KEY is set
   - Check RESEND_FROM_EMAIL is set

2. **Email Not Sending:**

   - Verify Resend API key is valid
   - Check from email domain is verified
   - Check console logs for error messages

3. **Store Owner Email Not Found:**
   - Ensure team has a member with "owner" role
   - Check team member relationship in database

## üìä Database Integration

### Order Actions Enhanced

- `updateOrderWithProofOfPayment()` now sends emails
- `getStoreOwnerEmail()` retrieves owner email by team ID
- Proper error handling to not break order flow

### Store Owner Detection

- Queries `team_members` table for role = "owner"
- Returns first owner email found
- Handles multiple owners gracefully
